Machine Learning and Deep Learning Code Repository

This repository contains four iPython notebooks

01_Investment Analysis Assignment.ipynb: 
To create an Funding investment portfolio with presentation using Python Dataframe constructs, Data cleaning and various data visualization plots.

02_Telecom_Churn_Final.ipynb: 
Predicting Telecom Churn: Multiple models were built using Logistic Regression, SVM and PCA along with GridSearch of hyperparameters.

03_MNIST Digit Recognition Project.ipynb: 
MNIST Digit Recognition: Feed-Forward, Loss Function, Back-propagation using only basic Numpy constructs.

04_Gesture Recognition Project.ipynb: 
TV Gesture Recognition Project to identify five different hand gestures like thumbs up is to increase the volume, thumbs down is to decrease the volume. Two approaches were used for this:
1.	Using 3-D CNN Convolutions of the images. Kernel is a 3-D Kernel which does 3-D convolutions of the sequence of images.
2.	Using a CNN-RNN Stack: CNN acts as feature extractor and RNN processes these sequence features.
